## ⚠️ Known Limitation

* The **sidebar is not fully responsive in mobile view**. I was not able to complete the mobile responsiveness behavior for the sidebar (e.g., toggle menu / collapse functionality).

All other sections are implemented and working as expected.

---

## 📌 Notes

* The project structure is kept scalable and maintainable.
* Code is organized for readability and easy enhancements.
* With additional time, the mobile sidebar responsiveness can be completed using a toggle menu or drawer implementation.

If you tell me what exact features you added (API? filters? search? pagination? authentication?), I can customize this README specifically to your implementation so it looks stronger and more impressive.
